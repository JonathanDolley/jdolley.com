# a summary about you
summary: |
  I am a transdisciplinary researcher in sustainability transformations with a focus on food systems and the social and solidarity economy. Following my SPRU PhD exploring peri-urban food systems in Wuhan, China, I continued at SPRU as a Research Fellow from 2016 to 2024. During this time I was involved as a researcher on various international interdisciplinary projects with partners in India, China, Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania addressing topics such as ecosystem services and poverty alleviation, holistic landscape change, knowledge systems, STI policy, and the role of GIS and AI in democratizing land-use planning and decision making. My current research interest in the Korean cooperative movement was realized through a Marie Skłodowska–Curie Global Fellowship between 2021-2024 during which I lived in South Korea to research the Hansalim Life Movement. After leaving the University of Sussex in 2024 I became a visiting researcher at the Mosim and Salim Research Institute, Seoul. I have also continued to work with SPRU as a consultant on a project called LEAF Indonesia (2024-2026), looking at the sustainability implications of Indonesia’s Food Estates Program.

  I was born in London and now I live in South Korea with my wife, son and the cutest Maltese in the world. I am a massive book worm but I also find time to enjoy Korean culture and food and sing Karaoke with friends.

  I am writing a book about Hansalim which you can read online at [book.livingtogether.xyz](https://book.livingtogether.xyz) and my project website is [livingtogether.xyz](https://livingtogether.xyz) where you can find blog posts about my experience on the project.
