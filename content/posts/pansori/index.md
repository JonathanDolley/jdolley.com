Recently I have been learning about a genre of traditional Korean folk music called Pansori.

Iâ€™m am bringing a Korean folk duo (singer and guitarist) to the UK in January 2025. I want to organise some open mics and gigs for them while they are visiting.

Juhyeon is a classically trained Pansori singer and songwriter from Seoul. Pansori is a passionate, highly dramatic musical storytelling genre which soars from deeply emotional tragic love stories to comedic cameos and biting satire. For centuries it has been sung in the marketplace, the village square, in drinking dens and at shamanic rituals and even on stage in Korean operas. Most recently, Pansori has featured in the popular k-drama 'Jeongnyeon: The Star is Born' on Disney+.

Juhyeon and the guitarist Stephen Kang blend Pansori with a blues-folk flavor of guitar accompaniment to make this most authentic of Korean genres accessible to new audiences in Korea. Now, for the first time, they are bringing their unique live show of Pansori-blues fusion to the UK with a gig at The Brunswick in Brighton.
