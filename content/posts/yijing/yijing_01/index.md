#### The decision

You have met with the *geon (乾) gui*, and its words are these.
1. Won (元): Become the greatest of all people by embodying the fundamental values that permeate all things in heaven and earth, and secure leadership in all things. Embody universal values.
2. Hyeong (亨): You are worthy of offering sacrifices to God. Make sacrifices to please God and be in harmony with everyone/everything. You share your blessings and happiness with those around you and with all things.
3. Li (利): You will attain beneficial results in all things. Benefit should be a just harmony.
4. Jeong (貞): You may inquire about the society in which you live and the fate of your existence. Through divination, you can communicate with God and forge the right path. Jeong is the question, and God is the answer.

#### Notes

Article 188 is a sentence containing four characters of Won/Hyeong/Li/Jeong among the four gui-sa/hyo-sa.  

There are seven sentences that contain all the original gui in a row: 乾， 坤， 屯， 隨， 臨， 無妄，革.
